**Test Instances and Computational Results**

This repository contains a single file, Instances_Results.pdf, which provides the complete experimental material supporting the paper: Benders decomposition for the integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem under uncertainty (submitted to IJCIEOM 2026). All instances and results reported in the original manuscript are documented in detail in this file to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

*Contents*
The PDF includes:
- A detailed description of the instance generator
- Full specifications of all test instances
- Scenario definitions and parameter settings
- Comprehensive computational results comparing the monolithic MIP and the Benders decomposition approach


*Notes*
No source code is provided in this repository.
The repository is intended as a data and results companion to the paper.
