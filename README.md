# Test Instances and Computational Results

This repository contains a single file, Instances_Results.pdf, which provides the complete experimental material supporting the paper: "*From Baseline to Recovery: Benders for Berth Allocation and Quay Crane Assignment under uncertainty*" (submitted to IJCIEOM 2026). All instances and results reported in the original manuscript are documented in detail in this file to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

## Contents

The PDF includes:
- A detailed description of the instance generator
- Full specifications of all test instances
- Scenario definitions and parameter settings
- Comprehensive computational results comparing the monolithic MIP and the Benders decomposition approach
